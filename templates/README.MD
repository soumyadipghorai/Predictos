# Predictos
## Predict your potential networth using Ai

So I have been playing those fun `Facebook games` for a while where they say you'll get married in this year or you'll have this many kids bla bla. But noboady gives you the reason why? I think these are pretty random. So thought of building a fun game using `Machine Learning`, and provide **Data Driven** results.

----------------------------

## Approach : 

* I have collected data of top 100 richest persons in different fields. I have used `BeautifulSoup` to scrape [therichest.com](https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest).
* after collecting the data done some data cleaning and feature engineering on raw data. 
* fitted multiple regression model and used hyper parameter tuning to get the best result. 
* saved the model in a `.sav` file and.
* lated used the same model in the `flask app` 

------------------------------

## How to run? 

> To run the app you need to download this repository along with the required libraries. and you have to the `app.py` file. 

> after running `app.py` open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
